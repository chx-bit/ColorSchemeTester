You can run this project locally with just a modern web browser, thanks to the browser-based Tailwind engine.

### Prerequisites

* A modern web browser (e.g., Chrome, Firefox, Edge).
* A local web server to avoid potential CORS issues with file loading. The [Live Server](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ritwickdey.LiveServer) extension for VS Code is a great option.

### Installation

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone [https://github.com/chx-bit/ColorSchemeTester.git](https://github.com/chx-bit/ColorSchemeTester.git)
    ```

2.  **Navigate to the project directory:**
    ```bash
    cd ColorSchemeTester
    ```

3.  **Open `public/index.html`:**
    * Right-click the `index.html` file and open it with Live Server (or your preferred local server tool).

That's it! The project should now be running in your browser.

## üí° Project Purpose
